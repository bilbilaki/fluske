The first season introduces the main character, Meredith Grey, as she enrolls in Seattle Grace Hospital's internship program and faces unexpected challenges and surprises. Season one had nine series regulars, six of whom have been part of the main cast ever since. The season initially served as a mid-season replacement for the legal drama Boston Legal, airing in the Sunday night time slot at 10:00, after Desperate Housewives. Although no clip shows have been produced for this season, the events that occur are recapped in \"Straight to Heart\", a clip-show which aired one week before the winter holiday hiatus of the second season ended. The season was officially released on DVD as two-disc Region 1 box set under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season One on February 14, 2006 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.\n\nThe season's reviews and critiques were generally positive, and the series received several awards and nominations for the cast and crew. The first five episodes of the second season were conceived, written and shot to air as the final five episodes of the first season, but aired during the 2005-2006 season due to the high number of viewers that watched \"Who's Zoomin' Who?\", the season's highest-rated episode with 22.22 million viewers tuning in.","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":"https://youtu.be/qbkEtYz9acA","created_at":"2021-08-03T14:50:02.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T14:50:02.000000Z","unique_views_count":1},{"id":1,"tv_series_id":1,"tmdb_id":"60059","season_no":1,"season_slug":"rick-and-morty-season-1","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2013","thumbnail":"tmdb_pZoqbuJGaVM7vgzsSCPwRH5TCx5.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"80,81,82,83","a_language":"1","detail":"Rick and Morty visit a pawn shop in space, encounter various alternate and virtual realities, and meet the devil at his antique shop.","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-03T14:39:23.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T14:39:23.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":2,"tv_series_id":2,"tmdb_id":"88380","season_no":1,"season_slug":"the-good-doctor-season-1","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2017","thumbnail":"tmdb_hiNyjUSTFrbMv3Sc0CxNW2o39az.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"84,85,86,87,88","a_language":"2","detail":"","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":1,"password":"eyJpdiI6Ii9SanV6QUVpODVFWXJKcDZOUU9GR0E9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiK1RLdHVxSFNQU3JKeTZmZm8yekhydz09IiwibWFjIjoiMzhjMjc1ODQ0MWQ5NGFmOGEyMzc0ZjU2NTljNjQxOWYzNjg4ZWE4ZDk3Zjc1MmIwMTI2ZTA3ZjhiNDI3YjQ1YiIsInRhZyI6IiJ9","trailer_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-03T14:45:35.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T14:45:35.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":4,"tv_series_id":4,"tmdb_id":"82752","season_no":1,"season_slug":"riverdale-season-1","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2017","thumbnail":"tmdb_iyLxqUGwOUurAKMOR8hSXmxMISU.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"94,95,96,97,98","a_language":null,"detail":"","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-03T14:55:05.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T07:05:52.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":5,"tv_series_id":4,"tmdb_id":"91793","season_no":2,"season_slug":"riverdale-season-2","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2017","thumbnail":"tmdb_yrsTz3PAUyKmLaNxvNOGX9alubu.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"94,95,96,97,98","a_language":null,"detail":"","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":"https://youtu.be/zwpOiPbybXw","created_at":"2021-08-04T07:02:02.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T07:02:02.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":6,"tv_series_id":1,"tmdb_id":"66738","season_no":2,"season_slug":"rick-and-morty-season-2","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2015","thumbnail":"tmdb_zkhGdE29umuKwa6u6mm7e4cXvYY.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"80,81,82,83","a_language":"1","detail":"After Rick and Morty decided to unfreeze time, they must deal with alien parasites, alternate Jerrys and a decaying, possibly non-existent dimension.","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":"https://youtu.be/7ecYoSvGO60","created_at":"2021-08-04T08:04:35.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T08:04:35.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":7,"tv_series_id":1,"tmdb_id":"86926","season_no":3,"season_slug":"rick-and-morty-season-3","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2017","thumbnail":"tmdb_lVcwMfbHx4QguLbZT4bink9mcgd.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"80,81,82,83","a_language":"1","detail":"Rick and Morty travel to Atlantis and take some time to relax, plus Rick turns himself into a pickle and faces off against the president.","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":"https://youtu.be/RLQPgnHhOjw","created_at":"2021-08-04T08:08:22.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T08:08:22.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":8,"tv_series_id":3,"tmdb_id":"3719","season_no":2,"season_slug":"greys-anatomy-season-2","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2005","thumbnail":"tmdb_bO0S3fU8Tcqn0g5DCmDcX1oqA2t.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"89,90,91,92,93","a_language":"1","detail":"The second season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy commenced airing on the American Broadcasting Company on September 25, 2005, and concluded on May 15, 2006. The season was produced by Touchstone Television, in association with Shondaland production company and The Mark Gordon Company, the showrunner being Shonda Rhimes. Actors Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, and T.R. Knight reprised their roles as surgical interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley, respectively. Previous main cast members Chandra Wilson, James Pickens, Jr., Isaiah Washington, and Patrick Dempsey also returned, while Kate Walsh, who began the season in a recurring capacity, was promoted to series regular status, after appearing in seven episodes as a guest star.\n\nThe season continued to focus on the surgical residency of five young interns as they try to balance to the challenges of their competitive careers, with the difficulties that determine their personal lives. It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington. Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second one provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions have on their careers. Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was the story line involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":"https://youtu.be/Yc9egebhm9g","created_at":"2021-08-04T08:21:39.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T08:21:39.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":9,"tv_series_id":6,"tmdb_id":"140930","season_no":1,"season_slug":"superman-lois-season-1","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2021","thumbnail":"tmdb_vlv1gn98GqMnKHLSh0dNciqGfBl.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"100,101,102,103,104","a_language":"1","detail":"","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-04T11:33:31.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T11:33:31.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":10,"tv_series_id":7,"tmdb_id":"59914","season_no":1,"season_slug":"peaky-blinders-season-1","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2013","thumbnail":"tmdb_yMvESLkgmtdAseh6LN97Ex92vvI.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"105,106,107,108,109","a_language":"1","detail":"","views":0,"featured":0,"type":"S","is_protect":0,"password":null,"trailer_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-04T11:39:22.000000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T11:39:22.000000Z","unique_views_count":0},{"id":11,"tv_series_id":7,"tmdb_id":"62804","season_no":2,"season_slug":"peaky-blinders-season-2","tmdb":"Y","publish_year":"2014","thumbnail":"tmdb_8vp08uElPn5S2jHSVuAjrytJiuH.jpg","poster":null,"actor_id":"105,106,110,107,108","a_language":"1","detail":"As the 1920s begin to roar, business is booming for the Peaky Blinders gang.
